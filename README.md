# ADS-Project-3

To use our code, “app_v2” should be run to create the web application that contains the 2 different versions of the personality test. "Creating App" is the initial version of this code left for reference. 

Next, “43project3_linked.R” contains the code that links our app’s results to a google form. “43project3_data.csv” has this data itself.

“ABtesting.qmd” and “ab-test.ipynb” both contain the data analysis of the previously mentioned data we collected.
